# Soulweaver's supplementary Rikaichan dictionaries

This repository contains dictionary files I've created for my own use to supplement
Rikaichan's basic ones with additional entries they don't have (mostly specialized
names from copyrighted works). Currently, there's only one of these: the names of
PokÃ©mon.

## How to use

* Have [Rikaichan](http://www.polarcloud.com/rikaichan) installed in your 
  Firefox, Pale Moon, Thunderbird, Seamonkey or other compatible program
* Also have the RCX Merge addon from the above website installed
* Have one or more Rikaichan dictionaries installed
* Clone this repository somewhere. Make sure your Git configuration keeps the
  original line feeds or converts them to LF only!
* Import the dictionary of your choice via `Tools > RCX Merge`
  * You will be asked, one at a time, whether you want to merge to each of the
    installed dictionaries until you answer 'yes' to one; in most cases, you'll
    want to merge my dictionaries into the Japanese Names dictionary.
  * Locate the dictionary file on your computer.
  * Next, you will be asked if the encoding looks correct. My dictionaries are
    in UTF-8, so the first presented encoding should be alright.
  * After that, RCX Merge asks you whether you want to replace the contents of
    the target dictionary. You will most likely want to answer this with 'no'.
  * After one more confirmation, the import begins. It shouldn't take too long.
